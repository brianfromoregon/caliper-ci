  Caliper CI

  1.0 features
  -- Jenkins plugin, but abstracted a reasonable amount
  -- Store all data as JSON
  -- After build, update threshold (lower or higher!)

  Post-1.0 features
  -- Compare other measurement types like timing. This requires looking at the environment (builds can run on slaves)
     and dealing with non-dedicated machines.
  -- Port appspot UI: http://microbenchmarks.appspot.com/run/jessewilson@google.com/examples.ArraySortBenchmark/1097001
  -- Other CI tools
  -- Tunable threshold, tolerance
  -- Charts
  -- Option to find and store code

  UI
  -- input, search strategy for results file
  -- output, (1) fail build (2) caliper link with logo like Git here: http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/job/jenkins_lts_branch/lastSuccessfulBuild/

Build time
  1. given, a "dir" and search strategy for results files
  2. find files, interpret as results. any issues, report on console output as warnings.
  3. load thresholds for relevant tests (from JSON)
  4. store new tests (in JSON)
  5. unstable build if things are worse

Show caliper info on job page
  1. given job number
  2. output number of parsed measurements (5 instance, 5 memory) and number of violated (3 failures) and link to details

Click on caliper jenkins link
  1. given, job number
  2. output a table. row is test name. columns are instance,memory,json. cells show new and old values. cells are red bg
     if its worse, green bg if better, white bg if same
