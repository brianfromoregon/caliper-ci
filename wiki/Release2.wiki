= Release 2 Features =

This release continues support for memory regression testing, so refer to the DemoRelease1 example to understand how that works.

Starting in 2.2, your Caliper results can be uploaded to a running Caliper Cloud instance such as http://microbenchmarks.appspot.com. See the job configure page.

In addition, I've added to the build results page:
  * A time column to the results table.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/caliper-ci/issues/detail?id=6 Trending graphs] for timing results
  * The build's environment properties

Of note, timing results cannot yet [http://code.google.com/p/caliper-ci/issues/detail?id=5 fail the build].

The new results page remains ugly, but it's richer:
